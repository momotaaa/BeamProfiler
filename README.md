# BeamProfiler
An multi-scale neighborhood search method for analysis of the laser beam images.

# Detecting Method
by Danile Zhu  
A quick and efficient method for calculating beam sizes from a single monochrome image using the ISO 11146 variance method. The algorithm has been refined to be less sensitive to background offset and noise.
ISO 11146 method for laser beam under natural backlight(Which intensity equal to 30~40)
